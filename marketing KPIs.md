# Evaluating ad campaigns and their marketing KPIs:

In this project I analyze effectiveness of three ad campaigns. The data contains information on each of the campaigns:
- date of an ad campaign,
- amount spent,
- impressions,
- clicks,
- visits,
- leads,
- sales,
- revenue.
## Information on ad campaigns
| Ad campaign   | Total spent on ad | Total sales | Total revenue | Impressions | Clicks | Visits | Leads |   
| ------------- |:-----------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Campaign # 1  |        9000       |     907     |      7969     |    993420   |  19601 |  18607 | 1796  |
| Campaign # 2  |        4892       |     295     |      13476    |    247809   |  2621  |  2486  |  497  |    
| Campaign # 3  |        13777      |    1558     |     21016     |    997628   |  15651 |  14911 | 2176  |

## Estimating marketing KPIs of each campaign
- CPM - Cost per mille
- CPC - Cost per Click
- CTR - Click-through rate
- CPV - Cost per Visit
- CPL - Cost per Lead
- CPS - Cost per Sale
- CAC - Customer Acquisition Cost
- ROMI - Return on Marketing Investment
##  Average marketing KPIs for the period
| Ad campaign   | Cost per mille | Cost per Click | Click-through rate | Cost per Visit | Cost per Lead |     
| ------------- |:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Campaign # 1  |       9.2      |        0.5     |          2%        |       0.5      |      5.1      |   
| Campaign # 2  |       20       |        2       |         1.1%       |        2       |      10       |    
| Campaign # 3  |       14       |        0.9     |         1.6%       |       0.9      |      6.4      |     

| Ad campaign   | Cost per Sale | Customer Acquisition Cost | Return on Marketing Investment |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| Campaign # 1  |     10.8      |             12.7          |              -10.8%            |
| Campaign # 2  |     17.7      |             19.5          |                180%            |
| Campaign # 3  |       9       |             11.2          |               53.6%            |

## Insights:
- The greatest amount of money was spent on ad campaign #3, but as a result of ad campaign #1 there was the greatest number of website visits and clicks, so campaign #1 has the highest click-through rate (CTR). On the other hand, ad campaign #3 has resulted in the highest sales among the three campaigns. So users of campaign #1 visited the website the most frequently but they bought less than users of campaign #3. <ins>So campaign #1 has a lower conversion rate of visits and clicks into sales than campaign #3. </ins>
- Ad campaign #2 has the highest cost-per-mille, -click, -visit, -lead, -sale and the highest customer acquisition costs. At the same time, revenue as a result of campaign #2 is twice as high as revenue as a result of campaign #1. <ins> It can be the case that an average receipt of a user of campaign #2 is significantly higher than average receipt of a user of campaign #1. </ins>
- Ad campaign #3 has the highest marketing costs, but the highest number of leads, sales and revenue. <ins> So users of campaign #3 visit the website and make purchases. </ins>
- In order to determine  the most efficient ad campaign among the three campaigns in this project I use ROMI indicator. <ins> Ad campaign # 2 is the most efficient since it has the highest ROMI.</ins> So given relatively low marketing expenses on campaign # 2, it generates relatively high revenue.
## Recommendation to the marketing department:
I would recommend to the marketing department to alter the ad campaign #1 since it has negative ROMI. Campaign #1 has a high number of clicks and visits, but high marketing expenses are not justified since revenue as a result of campaign #1 is lower than revenue of other campaigns.
