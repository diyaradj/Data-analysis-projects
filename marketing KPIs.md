# Evaluating ad campaigns and their marketing KPIs:

In this project I analyze effectiveness of three ad campaigns. The data contains information on each of the campaigns:
- date of an ad campaign,
- amount spent,
- impressions,
- clicks,
- visits,
- leads,
- sales,
- revenue.
## Estimating marketing KPIs of each campaign
- CPM - Cost per mille
- CPC - Cost per Click
- CTR - Click-through rate
- CPV - Cost per Visit
- CPL - Cost per Lead
- CPS - Cost per Sale
- CAC - Customer Acquisition Cost
- ROMI - Return on Marketing Investment
